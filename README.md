Hi guys my name is Saurabh and this is my first qiskit based repository. Here I shall upload some codes I found very fun and engaging. 
Since I am new to qiskit (1 month experience as of September 2020), don't expect anything complex here. 
This repository is dedicated to just learning and experimenting with qiskit.
